An executive dashboard with coffee orders and sales analyzed in Excel

# Data Organization: 
First off, I made sure all the sales data was clean and well-organized by ensuring there were no duplicates and fixing any incorrect entries.

# XLOOKUP and MATCH-INDEX: 
Then, I used XLOOKUP and MATCH-INDEX functions to pull specific data points. XLOOKUP is a lifesaver for fetching data based on a certain criterion. It's more flexible and powerful than VLOOKUP, especially when dealing with large datasets. For more complex queries, where I needed data based on multiple criteria, the MATCH-INDEX combo came in handy. It's like a dynamic duo for pulling precise info.

# Pivot Tables: 
Next, I created pivot tables to summarize the data. Pivot tables are great for quick, interactive summarization. I could easily break down sales by region, product, or time period - really helpful to get different perspectives on the data.

# Data Visualization: 
I then used pivot charts directly from the pivot tables to create graphs and charts. This made the data more digestible and visually appealing. You know, bar graphs for sales comparison, line charts for sales trends over time, that sort of thing.

# Dashboard Assembly: 
Finally, I assembled all these elements into a cohesive dashboard. Arranged the charts and data tables in a way that tells a story – showing key metrics at a glance, trends, and areas that need attention.
Review and Refinement: Gave it a thorough review, made some tweaks for better clarity and usability. It’s crucial to ensure the dashboard is intuitive and provides meaningful insights at a glance.

The result? A comprehensive, easy-to-navigate executive dashboard that provides a clear view of our coffee sales performance. It’s been a game-changer for quick, informed decision-making.
